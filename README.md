# Deploy-a-Web-Server-Azure


## Introduction

The infrastructure as code gives us a huge advantage in defining, deploying, updating and destroying our infrastructure. So to set up an image which contains our application for repeatable deployments, we will use packer to create the virtual machine images(in JSON format).

Terraform also expands on this by not only deploying virtual machines but also storage, networking and security entities across multiple infrastructures, clouds and vendors.

Based on these, this project will use a Packer template and a Terraform template to deploy a customizable, scalable web server in Azure.
